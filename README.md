# Student-Performance-Prediction-ML-
This project predicts student performance with a machine learning model trained on academic and demographic data. A Flask web app lets users input study habits and assignments to get instant score predictions. Low performers receive a quiz for improvement, combining data preprocessing, model inference, and a user-friendly interface.
